Brainwashed Gross Cat,2,Gacha Super Rares
"Brainwashed Gross (B.Sexy Legs) is a Crazed Legs variant with Surge instead of Wave. Its base stats are pretty much on par with Crazed version, having 21.4k HP and 3 KBs, 350 Range, and 1100 Single Target DPS for 600 cost and a 28.8s Cooldown. Its Surge is Level 3 and spawns randomly between 150 and 600 range. The implications of this are twofold. First, just like C.Legs's Wave, B.Legs's Surge grants it pseudo area attack. However, the Surge being Level 3 means enemies in that area can take up to three times his base DPS (3300) which is extremely powerful for a semi-stackable, cheap and bulky Super Rare. Secondly, however, unlike a wave which sweeps out a whole area, Surge appears randomly and concentrates fire on a specific area. In B.Legs's case, it is enemies in the range 275 to 350 who on average take the most hits from the Surge (~2700 DPS). At very low and high ranges, however, the Surge misses more often than not and the average DPS drops below that of a C.Legs. In short, B.Legs works more like an midrange LD attacker such Housewife or Fiend, than a Wave Attacker like its Crazed cousin. For midrange DPS, it has near unmatched power for its class, but for sniping 500+ range enemies, C.Legs's Waves will provide a more consistent source of chip damage."
