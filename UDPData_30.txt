Bodhisattva Cat,2,Gacha Super Rares
"Bodhisattva Cat (Avalokitesvara Cat) is a bad Floating CC unit that is easily outclassed. It has Area Attack, stands at 270 range, has a 40% chance to Slow Floating enemies for 4s, 2.5s attack frequency and a huge 40s Cooldown. Its long Recharge time is the reason it is a subpar unit, as a spammable unit like Sanzo performs the same role but more reliably due to greater numbers on the field. Yet, it is worth noting that Bodhisattva can still be useful in situations where the units that outclass it are not available, such as Red Cyclone Wrath."
"Tathagata Cat gets 30 more range and a new 30% chance to Weaken for 4s. Its original problem of having a long Cooldown is not solved and its niche is therefore not broadened, meaning Tathagata remains a subpar unit."
