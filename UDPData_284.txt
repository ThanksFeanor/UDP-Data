Express Cat,2,Advent and Cyclone Drops
"Express Cat (Maglev Cat) is an outstanding rusher with the Double Bounty ability. Maglev Cat has 15.3k HP with 1 KB, 25.5k damage, 140 range, 75 speed, 750 cost, and a 19.2s cooldown. This combination of high speed with an instant 1f foreswing and a high damage per hit makes Maglev Cat one of the best units in the game for landing precision hits to pick off a specific enemy. It can also use its speed to infiltrate LD blindspots, and suicide-rush enemies that are hard to approach with other cats. As a suicide rusher it usually will land one solid hit and then die, due to its 1 KB and modest HP, but enemies with KB or Warp abilities can be exploited to rebound attack and deliver even more damage. Its Double Bounty perfectly synergizes with its role by allowing it to precisely land the killing blow on weak enemies, making Maglev Cat near-essential for cash-tight stages. However, in long drawn out endurance battles with bulky enemies that are hard to precision-kill, cats with more surivability and sustained damage output over time become preferable to a suicide rusher like Maglev. Additionally, its single target can make it hard to use on spam stages."
"In True Form, Bullet Train Cat now has 20.4k HP and 29.8k damage as well as 85 speed. This does nothing to change Bullet Train Cat's core role, but simply makes it even better at what it already did well. In particular, the extra damage lets it land finishing blows for double cash in more situations, and the extra HP lets it further exploit KB/Warp enemies for more rebounds (most importantly, surviving a Yulala hit at level 38+)."
