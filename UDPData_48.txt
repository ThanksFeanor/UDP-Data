Pirate Cat,2,Gacha Rares
"Pirate Cat (Captain Cat) is an okay anti-Red Knockback unit with a 30% proc chance every 1.5s. He has 6000 HP and a cost of 510, stands at 270 range, and has a cooldown of 6s. Pirate Cat's proc chance is a little low and he's extremely fragile, but his high spammability means he remains somewhat useful. His range is sufficient to counter slow, bulky melee enemies like One Horn and Red Cyclone, and even to stunlock Dark Emperor Nyandam in stages like Last Gang with a stack of Pirates constantly knocking him back. Faster melee enemies like Shy Boy just rebound and quickly regain ground, though. While he is never entirely useless, other anti-Reds like iCat or Roe Cat will often perform better."
"In True Form, Dread Pirate Catley gains 300 range and a 40% proc chance. As well as this basic improvement of the Evolved Form's function, Catley also is surprisingly bulky at 15.3k HP which lets a stack of him actually have some survivability to keep KBing enemies even after losing some ground. These improvements give him what he needs to keep up with later-game harder Reds like Berserkory, countering him excellently on the notorious Boiling Spring and Manic Island stages, and especially in 4 Crown SoL or Bakoo Wrath where his Super Rare alternatives are unavailable. His Wave Immunity talent further expands his usage as a rare anti-Wave meatshield and further cements his effectiveness as a Berserkory/Two Can counter, again, especially in 4 Crown SoL."
