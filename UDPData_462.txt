Filibuster Cat X,4,Story Legends
"Filibuster Cat X is a terrible Super Backline CC unit with a 100% chance to Freeze Traitless enemies for 4s. He has 27k HP with 1 KB, 884 DPS, 575 range, 19.3s attack frequency, 12s foreswing, and a 151s long recharge. Besides that, he also has Omnistrike with an effective range of -500 to 575."
"Filibuster Cat X's main upside is its rare ability to provide a long-lasting Freeze against Traitless enemies. This, combined with his large range, means he can provide valuable support in a few niche situations. The most notable is in 4-Crown endurance stages such as Li'l Mohawk and Li’l Eraser to prevent the bosses from pushing too much."
"Despite having a unique ability, Filibuster Cat X is an awful unit. He has a 12s long foreswing which usually causes him to miss or fail to provide support at the right time, and having only 1 KB makes him unable to reposition when enemies reach him. Moreover, he has a low 20% Freeze uptime which makes him not worth the hassle to use him. In addition, his absurdly low DPS makes him unusable as a Super Backliner. And as you need to beat CotC 3 to unlock Filibuster, you've most likely already cleared a majority of the few stages that he might be useful in."
"In conclusion, Filibuster Cat is a nearly worthless unit due to its low stats, uptime, and incredibly long foreswing. This is all further worsened by how late you unlock him, potentially losing the little usage you could get out of him."
