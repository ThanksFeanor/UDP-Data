Kotatsu Cat,2,Gacha Super Rares
"Kotatsu Cat (Sadako Cat) is a strong anti-Floating Tanker, with Resistance to Floating, and a 30% chance to Weaken Floating enemies by 50%, for 6.67s. They also have 27k HP with 1 KB, 2000 DPS, 10 Speed, and 130 range, 720 cost and 9.9s Cooldown. With a great 163k effective HP including Weaken, Sadako can serve well as anti-Floating Tanker, particularly against longer-ranged threats like I.M Phace, Cli-One, Perfect Cyclone, etc. However, Sadako suffers from poor performance on mixed Floating stages with its low base HP and gets rather outclassed by Camera/Sanzo against melee Floating enemies."
"Octopus Cat gains Wave Blocker in True Form, granting it a whole new use. Octopus is now able to protect units on the field from dangerous wave enemies such as Berserkory, making most early-to-midgame wave stages like Manic Macho Legs and Darkweb trivial. Although it can still die rather quickly due to its low base HP and range, its low Cooldown means you can often have another one ready in time to maintain your defense. Note however that Octopus also has a longer backswing than Sadako, slightly lowering its Weaken uptime, so if you are using it for pure anti-Floating Tanking with no waves present, you may wish to switch back to second form. Overall, a very useful True Form to unlock."
