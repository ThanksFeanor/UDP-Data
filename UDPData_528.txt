Cossack Cat,2,Advent and Cyclone Drops
"Cossack Cat (Vodka Cat) is a bad stackable Melee attacker with Massive Damage against Relic. It has 15.3k HP and 2 KBs, a two hit Multi-Hit for 1000 Damage, 3100 DPS, 11 Speed, 130 range, 600 cost, and a 4.53 second Cooldown. While its good 9200 effective DPS and quick Cooldown have the makings of a good unit, Cossack is severely limited by its low range and survivability. As it stands, Vodka only outranges 3 Relic enemies, being Relic Doge, Sir Rel, and Oldhorn. The first two of these are better handled with other options such as Slapsticks, or, in 4 Crown UL, Teamaster Cat. This leaves its only plausible use case to be shredding Oldhorns, which can be annoyingly bulky, especially in 4 Crown restrictions where your offensive options are more limited. It is also usable in Prelude to Ruin."
