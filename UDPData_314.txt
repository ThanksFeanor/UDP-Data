Years-End Neneko,2,Gacha Super Rares
"Years-End Neneko is a bad Critical Hitter. Due to low health and damage, a low 15% crit chance and a very long cooldown, she is unusable as a critter. You can obtain better Critical Hitters very early in the game instead (Space Cat/Jurassic Cat)."
"In True Form, Festive New Year Neneko gains a 3-strike Multi-Hit attack with a 15% chance to deal a Critical Hit in each of them and a reduced cooldown. She has 1400 DPS, 220 range and a 43 second long cooldown. However, her True Form requires an Epic Catfruit Seed which ultimately makes her True Form unobtainable before late game. This reduces her usage a lot and her crit is still too unreliable to be used over other critters."
