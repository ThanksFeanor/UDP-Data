Urs & Fenrir,4,Story Legends
"Urs and Fenrir is a decent generalist Backliner with 5.2k DPS at 445 range, 30.6k HP and 4 KBs, and a 165s Cooldown with 4875 cost. It has a 20% chance to Weaken non-Metal enemies to half damage for 3s, and has Curse Immunity."
"Urs's biggest strength is its usage in 4-Crown restrictions. It has a build similar to a typical backliner uber with average DPS at a fair range. The Weaken ability is not consistent but can provide occasional periods of brief relief from high-pressure enemies, particularly Traitless enemies who have few other counters such as R. Ost. Urs works best when combined with Awakened Ururun who has a similar build, either to cycle between them, or to double up on firepower. Stages like 4-Crown Procrastinator Parade and Heavens Oasis which can be annoying with only Ururun as a reliable backline attacker, can be handled much easier with Urs also in your lineup. Urs can also be used as a replacement for Ururun when Ururun’s KB ability is undesirable."
"The biggest issue with Urs is how late you unlock it (UL 21). By this point, most late game enemies are too powerful for Urs to make much of a dent in. Most players will have a more effective Uber in their arsenal by this point, and prefer to use that. Its Weaken has too low a chance and uptime to ever be something you rely on, and is almost ignorable. The somewhat long cooldown is also inconvenient, especially on a unit with such low HP that will struggle to take hits even in the later parts of SOL, never mind late-game."
"While not very useful outside of 4-Crown restrictions due to how late you unlock it, Urs is a respectable non-gacha Backliner with stats between Evolved and TF Ururun. At worst, you now have essentially two Ururuns to work together, which comes in handy on tougher 4-Crown stages where one alone struggles."
