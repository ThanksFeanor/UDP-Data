Brainwashed Axe Cat,2,Gacha Super Rares
"Brainwashed Axe (Brainwashed Brave) is a very poor anti-Traitless CC unit. He has 6800 HP with 1KB, 472 DPS, 14 speed, 300 cost with a 2s Cooldown, and abilities of Strong and 30% Chance to Curse for 3s vs Traitless. Additionally, he has immunities to Knockback, Freeze, and Slow. Brainwashed Axe's stats are too poor to use as a meatshield even when Strong-boosted vs Traitless, despite only having 1 KB unlike other Axe variants. Instead, he is built to use his immunities and Curse to shut down Mr. Mole, Henry, and Croakley specifically. Although he is very effective at cursing these enemies once he reaches them, there are 2 big problems. The first is that these enemies are usually protected by other enemies that will destroy Brainwashed Axe, stopping him from doing his job for the majority of the stage. The second and most fatal problem is that by the time you are able to get cats into the blindspots of these enemies, you are already beating the stage whether or not you have Brainwashed Axe. Overall he serves no meaningful purpose."
