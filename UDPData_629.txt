Brainwashed Cat,2,Gacha Super Rares
"Brainwashed Cat (Brainwashed Macho Cat) is a useful anti-Aku and anti-Black meatshield, with a 30% chance to Dodge attacks for 2 seconds. It has 1700 HP with 3 KBs, 18 speed, 90 cost, and a Cooldown of 2s. It is much faster than a typical Basic Cat clone (more like a Crazed Cat clone) and unlike many Dodge-meatshields it is fully spammable and relatively cheap. With a decent chance to trigger Dodge, it is useful on just about any Black or Aku heavy stage, and especially in Aku realms where Dodge continues to work after the Level Seal ruins your other meatshields. It can also save you in a crisis against high-damage bosses which other meatshields struggle to stall, such as Le'Grim or Jagando."
