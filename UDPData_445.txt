Cutter Cat,2,Gacha Super Rares
"Cutter Cat (Power Cutter Cat) is a powerful anti-Red Rusher with the Massive Damage ability. It has 5100 health and 4250 base damage (13k to 17k against Reds depending on ItF treasure) alongside a great 50 speed, but most importantly it has the ability to Survive a lethal strike and gain a +400% Strengthen effect after doing so, bringing its anti-Red damage after that to a whopping 64k to 85k. With Weaken Immunity and this huge damage, Cutter is an especially powerful option against Hannya. Cutter is obviously not recommended for use outside Reds due to its poor base damage, but its performance can even be unreliable against Reds. Its low HP means it relies entirely on Survive to stay on the field and hope to land a rebound attack. This can be hard to predict and accurately time so, often, it'll instead land its weak first hit, trigger Strengthen, and then be obstructed by a peon or be hit again before landing the all-important Strengthened attack which delivers most of its damage. With a long 41s cooldown, this is hard to make up for. Cutter also notably has a useful 2 Slot Attack Up (Sm) combo with Li'l Brave Cat."
"Neo Cutter Cat gains a boost in attack power to 5100 base damage (20.4k anti-Red, 102k post Strengthen). It also gains Wave Immunity, improving its matchup against Berserkory and Two Can. However, as better options usually exist to deal with these enemies, Cutter remains generally limited to the same uses as before, though with better performance than before. For this reason, Cutter isn't a high priority to TF, especially since it requires an Epic Catfruit Seed, usually unavailable until the late game."
