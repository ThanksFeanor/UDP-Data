Good-Luck Ebisu,2,Gacha Super Rares
"Good-Luck Ebisu (Bad-Luck Ebisu) is a CC unit with a 30% chance to inflict each of KB, Weaken, Slow and Freeze to all traits for 1.67s to 2s on each of his three hits. Ebisu also has 27.2k HP with 3 KBs, 2400 cost, 44.53s Cooldown, 2600 DPS at 400 range (300 to 600 LD) and Single Target. Each hit has an effective 76% chance to proc some kind of effect, increasing to 99% across a whole attack cycle, such that he almost never fails to have some kind of impact. Ebisu's wide coverage of traits can be useful in mixed stages, as well as against early Relics like Primeval Cyclone and Relic Bun-Bun when the player may not yet have many other options. His large blindspot additionally makes him compatible with strategies involving stacking on startoff, such as Floor 48. Despite some modest potential, he is held back greatly by Single Target. It means he is overwhelmed in any spam stage, and elsewhere may waste his CC on an insignificant peon instead of the desired enemy. Despite having LD, this also means he can't exploit his piercing range unless enemies are in his blindspot to trigger attacks without also soaking them up. Even should he hit the right target, his inherent randomness means that instead of landing a desirable Slow or Freeze, he may deliver an underwhelming Weaken or even a potentially detrimental KB instead. Furthermore, his high cost and long Cooldown for a Super Rare mean that he is usually outclassed by sheer numbers of more spammable CC options when they are available. Overall, Ebisu is highly situational and shines in a few specific stages for those with the “Good-Luck” to have him, but his randomness, awkward Single Target LD, and high Cooldown all limit his overall value."
