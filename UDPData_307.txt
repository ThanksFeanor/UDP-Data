Vaulter Cat,2,Gacha Super Rares
"Vaulter Cat (Polevaulter Cat) is an excellent Super Rare that stands at 350 Range with LD from 200 to 500. She has a 50% chance to Slow Zombies for 4s, has 1700 DPS with Z-Killer, 10.2k HP with 3 KBs and a Cooldown of 21s with 1050 cost and 14 speed. Her 75% Slow uptime and wide LD area is effective for controlling groups of Zombies, especially when she is stacked. As an LD attacker, Vaulter's equal balance of inner and piercing range is ideal for hitting multiple layers of frontline enemies at once, but of limited use in sniping Backliners. Her fairly low HP also means that higher range and hard-pushing enemies or unburrowing/reviving Zombies in the blindspot can quickly kill your Vaulters, which is painful given her substantial cost and cooldown. It is also inconvenient for keeping her alive long enough to stack, which can leave you relying on a lone Vaulter's 50% proc."
"In True Form, Housewife Cat's stats increase to 12.8k HP, 20 speed and a 5s Slow. Her CC now reaches over 100% uptime with CotC fruits, further improving her anti-Zombie role. The boost in HP helps mitigate her weakness in this area, but she does still have survivability issues in late game. The higher speed is mostly a plus, letting her respond to threats swiftly while her long backswing animation usually (but not always) keeps her from rushing into unnecessary danger. The main appeal of her True Form, though, is her Savage Blow talent. This grants her a 30% chance to deal a devastating 28k damage LD attack that can leave a huge dent in the enemy lines. This not only improves her chances of landing a Z-Kill, but makes her an excellent general LD midranger with average DPS around 2800, matching Fiend Cat's power output but at a safer range."
