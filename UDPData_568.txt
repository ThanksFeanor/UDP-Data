Idi:N,4,Story Legends
"Idi:N2 is a good Melee Rusher with the extremely powerful ability to deal Massive Damage to Relics. At level 30, it has 26k HP with 5 KBs and 59.5k Damage or 13k DPS. It has 44 Speed, 170 range, 4200 cost, a 91s Cooldown, and an Immunity to Surge. Idi:N's First Form has lower stats, so the Evolved Form should always be used."
"Idi's main selling point is its extremely high burst damage (179k effective Damage) and DPS (38k effective DPS) against Relics, with rebounds increasing its DPS even further. Idi is particularly effective against Mr. Puffington when isolated or unsupported, able to quickly kill it in two hits at level 40, and is also a powerful tool against an exposed Othom and Loris, or to rush down Oldhorns. Idi also has some merit as a generalist Rusher, and while being outclassed by ABaha, they work well in tandem. Idi’s immunity to Surge rarely comes into use, but can be helpful on stages like Possessed by Evil or Water Conservancy."
"Like Bahamut, Idi's main weaknesses are its low HP and short range. The low HP is especially bad considering that Idi is only available by late-game, where enemies start to hit increasingly hard. Against Relics, some longer-ranged ones can give Idi trouble; its performance against Lowkey being unreliable without speed combos, and can get easily shut down by M. Ost without either very good timing or the help of a Freeze CC like Doron."
"Overall, Idi is a valuable unit to own for all of Uncanny Legends, being extremely helpful when it comes to both rushing down ranged Relics and ripping apart melee ones. And while it's mostly overshadowed as a generalist by Bahamut, it can still be useful for some non-Relic stages to support your other Rushers."
