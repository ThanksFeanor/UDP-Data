Ururun Wolf,4,Story Legends
"Ururun Wolf is a decent Backliner with 24k HP, 4300 DPS, 4 KBs, 8 Speed, 3.57s attack frequency, 440 range, 4950 deploy cost and a 161s Cooldown. She also has the ability to KB non-Metal enemies with a 20% proc chance. In True Form, Awakened Ururun has improved stats, with 36k HP, 6400 DPS, 450 range, and Curse Immunity. Ururun Wolf has the same stats in First and Evolved form."
"Ururun Wolf’s main strength is her fast attack rate from a safe range, which gives her very consistent DPS. This allows her to be used in early game as a strong Backliner. In True Form, she becomes a very strong Backliner, able to compete even with strong generalist Backline Ubers in end game with her increased stats. Her ability to KB non-Metals is also a rare ability that can be useful in a few niche situations like Leadfoot Drive or Manic Eraser where other CC options may not exist or work due to range, with an albeit low proc chance but a high attack rate to compensate somewhat."
"While Ururun's KB can be nice, it is often an ability that can be inconsistent and can even backfire in certain situations. In situations where Ururun's KB is wanted, her low 20% chance makes her proc unreliable and makes it hard to use her as a primary CC unit. In situations where her KB is unwanted, Ururun can end up pushing your units into enemy Backliner attacks, and in some situations, can even get herself killed. Combined with her expensive cost and lacking HP, this means Uber Backliners are usually preferable, only used as a last resort should you lack them, or in 4*."
"Overall, Ururun is an excellent unit for no gacha standards, and can compete with very strong Ubers in terms of raw stats. However, she is somewhat difficult to use and, depending on RNG, can mess up your entire run, which limits her usage. Nevertheless, her high stats makes her a useful unit to own, especially when players lack strong Backliners."
