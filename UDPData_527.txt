Slime Cat,2,Advent and Cyclone Drops
"Slime Cat (Jellycat) is a Melee Wave Sniper that creates a Level 5 Wave Attack which extends to 1133 range. Unlike other Wave Attackers, Slime is a glass cannon, with 1700 HP and 1 KB and just 140 range, but a huge 25.5k Damage, 15 Speed, 450 cost, and a 12.5s Cooldown. Its high damage and wave level allow it to deliver a quick burst of damage across the enemy lines. Slime shines at clearing moderately bulky peons, crippling stronger enemies to be more easily finished off by your other units, and chipping away at backliners. Especially at higher levels where it can one shot/OHKB even stronger enemies, Slime’s offensive potential is among the best in the game. On the other hand, Slime’s durability is near non-existent, meaning it relies on utilizing enemies with blindspots, with long gaps between attacks, who can be Frozen, or with lower range than itself, to stay on the field long enough to land an attack. On stages without such openings to exploit, Slime may do almost nothing, and even when it can find an opening, good timing is essential. Additionally, while Slime’s foreswing is quite fast, it is not instant, so against lower-endurance enemies your other cats can cause it to miss. Slime’s relatively low cooldown and cost, however, mean that you can afford to occasionally have a Slime miss, or die before attacking, and as long as a decent number of your Slimes end up successfully attacking, they can destroy many stages in a way little else can."
