Easter Neneko,2,Gacha Super Rares
"Easter Neneko is a bad Critical Hitter. Due to low health and damage, low 10% crit chance, single target, and a very long cooldown, she is not useful for anything. You can obtain better critical hitters very early in the game instead (Space Cat/Jurassic Cat)."
"The True Form, Blossoming Neneko, gains the ability to Knockback, Freeze, Slow and Weaken Metals. Each has a 15% chance, and the relevant ones have a duration of 1.5s (60% uptime). The unreliability of this combined with the impossibility of stacking her means this is entirely irrelevant. "
