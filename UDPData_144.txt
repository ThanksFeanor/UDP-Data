Cat Base Mini,2,Gacha Super Rares
"Cat Base Mini (Cat Base Jr.) is a terrible Wave attacker due to having a pathetic 200 DPS, paired with a sluggish Cooldown of 26s. Just use Crazed Gross Cat instead, who performs the same role with better stats."
"In True Form, Cat Base Ultra gains increased attack, standing range and Wave reach making it closer to its rival, Manic Macho Legs. However, it is still outclassed in the most important field: DPS, meaning that Cat Base Ultra remains a subpar Wave attacker."
