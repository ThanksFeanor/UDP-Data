Catornado,2,Advent and Cyclone Drops
"Catornado (Hurricat) is a useful anti-Metal Melee attacker. It has 15k HP, 180 range, and attacks 5 times a second, with a 5% chance to perform a critical hit for about 1000 damage. Hurricat's high attack speed, high critical hit frequency, and area attacks make it a great counter to Metal Doge spam and other weaker Metals. Hurricat also benefits greatly from critical hit combos, due to its mixture of a low critical chance with fast attack speed. However, other critters are usually preferred for bulkier Metal enemies, as while Hurricat's critical hit frequency is high, its average critical DPS is on the low side, and its frequent, weak critical hits can juggle Super Metal Hippoe, making other critters like Waitress miss. Its HP is also somewhat low, which is detrimental on stages that mix Metal enemies with stronger pushers or backliners. Finally, Hurricat's 19-second Cooldown is rather long for such a short-ranged cat, so losing it soon after it's spawned can be very harmful."
"The True Form, Catyphoon, gains increased HP (26k) and speed (14). The increased HP is a nice buff, considering Hurricat's low HP — notably, it now survives a hit from Daboo at level 36 or higher, which is helpful on the infamous March to Death. Increased speed, however, is more mixed; it can be useful to get Catyphoon to the frontlines faster or on stages that mix Metals with LD enemies, but can also cause it to outrun meatshields and run into danger. Overall, Catyphoon is nice to have, but isn't necessary to make use of the unit."
