Tropical Kalisa,4,Ubers and Legends
"Tropical Kalisa, type X is a good midrange Rusher unit with 27 Speed, 340 range, 34k base Damage and 6800 base DPS. Besides that, she also has 43k HP with 5 KBs, and a core ability of Massive Damage vs Red. Her CD is about a minute, and she costs 3900 to deploy."
"Tropical Kalisa does very well against Red enemies, especially as they tend to have lower range, and she can comfortably attack from a safe distance in most cases. With her high DPS (27k effective DPS vs Red), you can send her out easily and kill frontline Red enemies, and her rebound mechanism boosts her effective DPS to even higher levels. To compensate for her low survivability, she is given the typical low CD and manageable cost of a Rusher. With her huge speed and medium range, you can easily time her into enemy blindspots, and get some decent general Midranger usage."
"The primary weakness of Tropical Kalisa is that her general usage drops off in the late game compared to other Rushers. As with many seasonal Ubers, her stats are overall a bit lacking compared to Ubers with True Forms, and especially her low health can be a problem. Also in late game, magnified Red enemies like Bores and Capies have rather a lot of HP and can tank a few of her attacks, meaning that while she will still remove respectable fractions of their HP, she might not continue to be as dominant."
"In conclusion, Tropical Kalisa is a good anti-Red Rusher to have throughout the game. Her performance as a general midrange Rusher is also satisfactory, especially if you are not too deep into the late game, where her underwhelming HP and increasingly bulky Red threats put a dent in her performance."
