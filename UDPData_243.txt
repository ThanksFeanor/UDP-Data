Holy Coppermine,4,Ubers and Legends
"Holy Coppermine is a poor Midranger who specializes in her 50% chance to proc Freeze against Angel and Alien enemies from 375 range for 4.67 to 5.6 seconds, depending on treasures. The Evolved Form has 39k HP, 4700 DPS, 7 Speed, 375 range, and 3 KBs with the same niche as her First Form. She also costs 3720 to deploy and has a 57.8s Cooldown ."
"Holy Coppermine has a few strengths to match up to her many weaknesses, those strengths being a quick recharge, a slightly fast attack speed, and low cost, allowing her to be stacked more efficiently than most Ubers in an attempt to make her otherwise inconsistent procs more reliable."
"Past early game enemies, Holy Coppermine struggles in her niche to CC Angel and Alien enemies. As she does not have a near 100% chance to Freeze Angels and Aliens and less than 75% uptime, her inconsistent freeze procs leave her undesirable for Freeze when Seafarer and Juliet the Maiko are available to the player. Her poor range allows her to just barely outrange Angelic Sleipnir but overall will not be a viable and useful option to the player due to her poor DPS, HP, and KB count, hindering her survivability further."
"To summarize, Holy Coppermine is a poor Uber to have as she is outperformed by several units that cover her niche as a result of her terrible survivability. She may be seen as useful in early game due to lack of CC options towards Angel and Alien enemies, but as Angels and Aliens get harder and more CC options are available, she is left in the dust as an unreliable crowd controlling Uber. Very similar in stats to Seabreeze Coppermine aside from enemy typing, Freeze uptime, and recharge, in which Holy Coppermine is slightly superior, but nevertheless makes her no better for generalist usage."
