Masked Yulala,4,Story Legends
"Masked Yulala (Mystic Yulala) is a bad midrange sniper with the Long Distance ability. At level 30 (both forms have identical stats), he has 8500 DMG, 4200 DPS, a 2.03s attack frequency, 34k HP, 2 KBs, 20 speed, 4200 cost, and a 95s spawn. He has 350 standing range with his Long Distance hitting between 200 to 500 range."
"Mystic Yulala's primary strength comes from his decent LD DPS combined with a very quick attack rate. This makes him able to quickly clear the enemy frontline of weak peons and enemies with low endurance, making it easier for heavier attackers to deal with the stage's main threat. He can also provide helpful chip damage to enemy backliners. Lastly, his high speed can be helpful when rushing or when invading LD enemy blindspots."
"Mystic Yulala's main problem is that he ends up being very difficult to keep alive during battle. His very quick attack rate and short backswing means he will constantly move ahead of your support, and his low KB count makes him prone to getting killed very quickly when enemies reach him. Another weakness is that by the time Mystic Yulala is obtained, there are already much more effective units to fill his role. One such unit is Housewife Cat who functions very similarly but is much more cost efficient, is less suicidal, and can accumulate DPS better. Finally, not having a specific niche beyond his LD attacks makes Mystic Yulala fall off even more in late game where specialists become more preferable."
"In conclusion, Mystic Yulala offers some promise as a nice midrange LD attacker, however his build often works against him, reducing the support he can provide. Being acquired so late into the game means that there are very few stages where he can outperform alternatives. He can still have some niche use cases such as clearing Trolly Bloggers in New Testament but there won't be much other reason to bring him."
