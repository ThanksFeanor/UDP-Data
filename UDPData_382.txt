Glass Cat,2,Advent and Cyclone Drops
"Glass Cat (Macho Glass Cat) is a situationally useful anti-Traitless CC unit. It has 1700 HP with 1 KB and the Metal ability (takes 1 damage from non-crits), 1700 Single Target damage, 40 speed, 140 range, 1f foreswing, and 450 cost with a 24.53s Cooldown. Macho Glass Cat's main ability is 100% Slow vs Traitless for 8.33s, and it is Immune to Wave, Knockback, Freeze, Slow, Weaken, and Warp. Lastly, Macho Glass Cat dies after attacking once. Macho Glass Cat's main strength comes from its incredibly long Slow duration against Traitless enemies who have few other control options. It is extremely effective against tough lone Traitless bosses, temporarily stopping them in their tracks and taking pressure off the player. Its speed, foreswing, status immunities and Metal ability leave most Traitless enemies with no way of avoiding this, however R. Ost's crits and Uril's Curse can notably neutralize it. Dying after one attack combined with its Single Target means it cannot control groups of enemies, nor can it stack or provide sustained control like more conventional CC. Its long Cooldown also makes it incredibly punishing if it doesn't hit the intended target."
"In True Form, Macho Crystal Cat has its Slow duration increased to 10s and it gains a 100% chance to Knockback Traitless. The longer Slow duration naturally makes it even better at what it already did before True Form, but its Knockback serves the additional purpose of regaining lost ground against hard pushing Traitless bosses. These two effects synergize well, taking the boss away from the frontline and keeping it there, while you deal with peons or regroup your defenses."
