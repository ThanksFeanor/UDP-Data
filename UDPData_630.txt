Calligraphy Cat,2,Advent and Cyclone Drops
"Calligraphy Cat (Tea Master Cat) is a niche Wave and Surge Immune meatshield. It has 6500 HP with 1KB, 1800 Single Target DPS, 10 Speed, 510 Cost, 8.5s Cooldown and 330 range. It has Strong vs Relic, Curse Immune, Wave Immune, and Surge Immune. Tea Master's long cooldown, low survivability, and lack of AoE completely cripple its potential as a stackable Midrange attacker, even against Relics, and it hence falls far short of Slapsticks in this role. The only use that Tea Master sees is as a Wave/Surge Immune attacker/meatshield in stages like Infernal Tower F30 or 4 Crown SoL/UL."
