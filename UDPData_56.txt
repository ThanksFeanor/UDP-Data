Archer Cat,2,Gacha Rares
"Archer Cat (Cupid Cat) is a horrible Single Target anti-Floating midranger with the Massive Damage ability. He has 4080 HP with 3 KBs, and deals 2100 effective DPS against Floating. He stands at 340 range, has a cost of 1230, and a cooldown of 11s. Before True Form, his DPS is too low to deal considerable damage to any Floating enemies and he also has low survivability with his abysmal HP. All of this, combined with his long recharge and hefty cost, makes him practically useless."
"In True Form, Cataur gains some much needed buffs, with stats rising to 6120 HP, 3100 effective DPS (4200 with ItF treasures), and 390 range. However, even with much improved stats, he is still far from amazing and Single Target is a big drawback. Cataur is therefore overshadowed by Cameraman Cat in all ways except range. This one advantage though lets him start to fill a small niche, tackling ranged Floatings like I.M. Phace and Owlbrow. His most valuable usage is in Tiny Wings, as a usable counter to the Owlbrows. Cataur's talents are also mediocre; his Target Zombie and Z-Kill talents expand his niche to include ranged Zombies, most notably Cadaver Bears, though Shigong Cat is usually more than enough to handle those. Again, much like in his Floating niche, he is outperformed against shorter-ranged Zombies by the likes of Li'l Flying, Cadaver BearCat or Housewife. Overall this leaves Cataur of limited use throughout the whole game."
