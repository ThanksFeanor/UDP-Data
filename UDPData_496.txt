Narita Kaihime,4,Ubers and Legends
"Narita Kaihime is a decent general Backliner with a guaranteed Slow proc against Black enemies and Zombies that lasts 3 seconds with full treasures. In her True Form she has 109k HP, 2 KBs, 440 range, 4800 base DPS, and 5 Speed. She also has Zombie Killer and a 25% chance for a Savage Blow."
"Kaihime's main usage is as a powerful Backliner, boasting a solid 7200 effective DPS after factoring in average luck on her Savage Blows, as well as a very high health pool which allows her to tank hits from some LD enemies. Alongside her general stats, she is also a decent Zombie Killer. Her high health lets her tank Zombie peons that have revived or unburrowed into her hitbox, and her low speed allows her to act as a base guardian, being able to kill unburrowing Zombies near the base. Against Zombies her CC effect can help to control strong pushers such as Cadaver Bear and Dread Bore, with uptime varying from 47% to 57% depending on treasures."
"However, Kaihime has a number of weaknesses. Her slow speed, while good against Zombies, hurts her general usage since it takes a while for her to reach the frontline. Her health is very high, but her survivability is low since her low KB count limits her chances for repositioning. Additionally, her 7200 effective DPS is dependent on Savage Blow RNG, so you won't always get consistent damage output from her. Her Slow ability isn't too useful against Black enemies since anti-Black CC is dominated by Bombercat."
"Overall, Kaihime's strong general stats make her a very good Backliner despite her weaknesses, and she is able to perform well as a Zombie Killer. Her usage falls off later in the game as her high health becomes less effective against buffed enemies and the demand for generalists falls as players get more specialists. Despite this, she is still a nice unit to pull to counter Zombies."
