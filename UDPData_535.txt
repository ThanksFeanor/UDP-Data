Hatsune Miku,4,Ubers and Legends
"Hatsune Miku is a somewhat lacking Midranger with 43k base HP, ~3800 base DPS at 350 range and 15 Speed. She is Strong against and weakens Red, Angel and Floating enemies for 2s to 2.4s, depending on treasures. She has 3900 cost and a 71 second Cooldown."
"Hatsune Miku's main strength is her ability to Weaken 3 traits. Her short CD and low cost allows you to stack her to increase her uptime on the Weaken, which is needed to make it consistently useful. Her boosted stats vs her 3 traits are also not bad at all (100k effective HP, 7000 effective DPS) especially when considering, again, that she stacks quite easily."
"She has multiple flaws, however. One major one is her low base stats. 4000 base DPS is quite poor for a Midranger in general use especially. She relies very heavily on the extra HP granted by her Strong ability and some help from her Weaken against her traits to survive long enough to stack, but cannot easily do this outside of her niche with only 40k HP, low range and slightly suicidal speed. Furthermore, achieving permaweaken requires at least 3 properly desynced copies of her, and non-Uber alternatives can usually do the job more reliably."
"Overall, Hatsune Miku is very lacking, both in terms of stats and ability, and is rarely used outside of early game. She has some potential to be useful against Red, Floating and Angel enemies when non-Uber alternatives are not fully effective, but is likely not going to be the greatest help even then."
