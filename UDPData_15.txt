Panties Cat,2,CF-Purchasable Specials
"Panties Cat (Leaf Cat) is an abysmal midrange attacker. It is a cheaper clone of Sexy Legs Cat, making it completely unusable beyond the very beginning of the game. Its True Form, Lollycat, gains Area Attack but by this point you will have gacha units such as Paris Cat for much better midrange AoE spam. Its only redeeming factor is its Cat Cannon Recharge Up M combo with Pastry Cat and Marshmallow Cat, which can be useful for Holy Blast spam strategies."
"Lollycat's only relevant talent is a 30% chance to Slow Metal enemies for 4s. With this, Lollycat becomes one of the best Metal CC options due to its insanely fast recharge (2.20s), high range (350), and Area Attack. While Cyclone Drop cats can generally handle Metal enemies, making this talent far from essential, it can be a very effective option if you do want an extra edge against Metals and can spare the NP."
