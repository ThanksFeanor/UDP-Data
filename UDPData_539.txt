Rugby Cat,2,Advent and Cyclone Drops
"Rugby Cat (Quarterback Cat) is a terrible anti-Black midrange LD unit with 6800 HP, 1000 AoE DPS, 18 speed, 900 cost, and a 15.2s cooldown. He also stands at 325 range, with LD from 225 to 475, is Strong Against Black enemies, and has Wave Immunity. Due to his mediocre DPS and sluggish cooldown, he fails as a stackable midrange or LD attacker. Even his effective stats against Black enemies are severely underwhelming by the point of the game you unlock him. Rugby's Wave Immunity has some niche usage in some 4 Crown wave stages, but is easily outperformed by Dancer Cat."
