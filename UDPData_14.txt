Cats in a Box,2,CF-Purchasable Specials
"Cats in a Box (Cat Gang) is a poor Melee rusher with 1500 DPS, 14k HP with 3 KBs, 140 range, 35 Speed, 1125 cost and 6.53s cooldown. As their stats are far too low to redeem their excessive cost, they are unusable outside of EoC as a treasure farming unit due to their high speed. Their True Form, Heavy Assault C.A.T, receives a 30% chance of Weaken vs Black enemies for 6.67 seconds, decreases Speed to 30, and increases range to 199. They remain unusable even in their niche as Bomber Cat is far more effective at keeping Black enemies at bay."
"When talented, Heavy Assault C.A.T becomes an excellent anti-Black Rusher. With both Massive Damage and Attack Up talents, they have 10.9k DPS and 36.7k raw damage to Black enemies, which pairs excellently with the unit's fast foreswing, rebound and fast speed, allowing them to quickly dish out great damage even to high range Black enemies. The HP Up talent is also welcome as it increases their chance of using all their KBs, being especially effective when Heavy Assault C.A.T manages to land a Weaken. In this role, they find competition in Assassin BearCat, who features higher damage at the cost of lower range and speed. As an anti-Black killer, Pizza Cat is more reliable than both when speed isn't needed, due to superior damage and range, and Waves when talented. In the end, Heavy Assault C.A.T. finds most of its use in 4 Crown restrictions and in stages that feature dangerous Black enemies that demand fast units to be effectively countered, like Primitive Souls."
