Marauder Cat,4,Ubers and Legends
"Paladin is a unit that is specialized to kill Metal enemies with a 50% Critical Hit chance. His general stats are poor; 39k HP with 3 KBs and 6800 base Damage (1400 DPS) at 245 range. His cooldown is 48s and he costs 2250. Through talents, he also can obtain a 30% chance to Freeze Metal enemies for 2 seconds, Slow Immunity and Zombie Killer."
"Paladin is a decently consistent critter with half of his attacks dealing solid damage to Metals. He has cheap cost and fast recharge rate, letting him be easily replaced if one is down. He is also granted with area attack, which helps him clear peons with ease and damage the main threat at the same time. This further improves his ability as an anti-Metal attacker, making him one of the best anti-Metals in the game with his consistent area crits and short cooldown."
"Despite his strength against Metals, Paladin has utterly garbage stats outside of them, his DPS is awful for any range class but especially useless on a melee-range attacker. It doesn't help that his survivability isn't that great, with low health and KB count. He also has Knockback Immunity, which makes him worse as he cant use SMH's KB ability to reposition himself to safety. To add insult to injury, his talents are also terrible, with Zombie Killer which is completely irrelevant as he has low damage output, Slow Immunity that only works in one stage (March to Death) and Freeze ability that has too low duration for what it's worth."
"Overall, Paladin is a unit that works extremely great against Metals, but has terrible generalist usage due to his low stats. If you are struggling against Metals, definitely a unit that can help you a ton, but outside of that, not a good unit to use."
