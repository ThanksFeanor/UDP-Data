Valkyrie Cat,4,Story Legends
"Valkyrie Cat is a terrible midrange Attacker/CC unlocked on completion of EoC2. Her Evolved Form has 23.8k HP with 2 KBs, 2000 DPS at 350 Range, while having a 65s cooldown and 3000 cost. Her TF, unlocked upon ItF2 Clear, increases her DPS to 2800, and also grants her a 35% chance to Freeze non-Metals for 2s (2.4s with treasures) which is about 50% uptime with her 4.3s attack cycle."
"Her biggest strength is that she is obtained very early in the game, so people yet to unlock gacha midrange area attackers, like Salon or Surfer, have something to fill this role even if poorly. Her TF can also provide limited CC support in early-mid game, particularly to Freeze enemies lacking other CC options like Traitless enemies. Lots O' Lion, in particular, is one of the few notable stages where she gets used for her CC."
"Both Valkyrie's physical stats and her control ability are slightly superior to a pre-TF Gacha Super Rare like Castaway Cat. However, her cost and cooldown are more than triple his, making her both disgustingly cost inefficient and essentially unstackable. This makes her replaceable by almost any unit with the same build, and only usable in the extremely early game as she is just too weak to have any measurable impact later on. Even then, she is forced to rely on getting perfect RNG to deliver just an underwhelming ~50% uptime at best. She often requires resets/retries before she manages to proc enough to matter in a stage."
"To conclude, Valkyrie Cat is an easily accessible but terrible midrange attacker who at best can be used to some effect in EoC3 before Gacha alternatives are unlocked. Her Freeze in TF is inconsistent, and is almost never used except when desperate against early game Traitless enemies."
