Delinquent Cat,2,Gacha Super Rares
"Delinquent Cat (Angry Delinquent Cat) has 4000 DPS Area Attacks with 250 Range, and each of his three hits has a 16% chance to Freeze Floating for 2s, for an effective 41% chance of at least one proc across his 3.23s attack cycle. These stats by themselves are respectable, but ruined by his ridiculously long 48.53s Cooldown which completely impedes you from building a worthwhile DPS or CC stack. He is hence never used in either role when other options for DPS or CC (Surfer, Cameraman, Sanzo...) are available. Delinquent's 1500 cost is also rather high but this is ironically what gives him one of his only valid uses; 1200+ cost restriction stages like Wrath of Red Cyclone."
"Ultra Delinquent Cat now has 50% improved HP, stands at 280 range, has 34.2s Cooldown, targets Relic, and is Curse Immune. As an attacker, Strengthen and Savage Blow talents can bring his average DPS up to a rather impressive 7200, but his Cooldown is still far too long for this to be worth investing in. As one of few Relic CC options, he could be useful in early UL to control Oldhorns while also providing some DPS, but players usually invest their Elder Catfruit in more useful alternatives this early on. Curse Immunity makes Delinquent theoretically useful against mixed Floating-Relic stages, but there are few-to-no such stages where he wouldn't be thwarted by a higher-range Relic like M. Ost or Othom. He does however find an oddly specific niche against Floating stages with a Relic Doge Base such as The Prince's Woods."
