Twinstars,4,Ubers and Legends
"Twinstars is a good anti-Alien/Black midrange Rusher unit with 350 range, 32 Speed and AoE attack. They have 28.5k base damage which is spread evenly across a 3 hit multi-hit and amounts to around 7100 base DPS. Durability isn't their main selling point as they have 37.4k HP and 4 KBs, but a 61s Cooldown. Their core ability is Massive Damage to Alien and Black, as well as Weaken Immunity."
"Their strength is in countering swarms of enemies with rapid attacks, and alleviating the pressure on your frontline. Multi-hit also helps them not to overextend in some cases. They shine against melee bosses like Bun Buns and even strong peon spam as their DPS in their niche (28k effective DPS) coupled with their fast attack rate makes them very useful when encountering tremendous pushing power. Their CD and lower cost can lead to having multiple of them and makes replacing them when they fall easier."
"Their speed can make them clip into the enemy lines too much, which alongside their small HP pool makes them often rather short-lived. Having multi-hit can also decrease their potential DPS on a target. Their role as a midrange attacker/swarm stopper can be replaced by a stack of Super Rares for either trait (Seafarer, Pizza, even general midrange spam like Camera/Cyborg/Drama)."
