Curling Cat,2,Advent and Cyclone Drops
"Curling Cat (Zamboney Cat) is a highly unique cat used exclusively to stall enemies. It has 68k HP with 1 KB, 120 range, 720 cost, 25 Speed and 31.2s cooldown. It is most known for its incredibly long, 4.5 minute attack frequency. During this time, it does not move forward or damage any enemies. It is also immune to Waves, Knockback, Freeze, Slow, Weaken and Warp. This property, along with its huge HP, allows it to act as a perfect staller. On base-hit stages with manageable peons, such as An Ancient Curse or Floor 48, it can almost single-handedly provide the defense needed for you to comfortably stack cats or build your wallet. Additionally, it can also help in many general stages as a supporting meatshield to temporarily halt the enemy advance and protect your attackers, including examples such as Floor 39, Floor 45 and Floor 46. Its long cooldown does however mean you often need other defensive options in the downtime between Zamboneys."
"In True Form, Green Shell Cat's Speed increases to 35, and its HP increases to 102k. This 50% increase in HP makes Green Shell Cat significantly better at its job, allowing it to stall more things for longer, and keeps it relevant deep into late game. Many strategies rely on a sufficiently boosted Green Shell buying you the time needed to stack units or destroy the enemy base. The extra speed is appreciated too as it lets Green Shell reach the frontline faster to react to threats in time. Overall, while Green Shell Cat isn't a unit to bring to every stage, its unreasonably high health and unique properties as a staller make it irreplaceable in specific situations."
